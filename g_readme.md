This is the graphics portion of dwarf fortress. The repository is barebones for now; I'm not fully aware of all the stuff being kept track of before. As time goes on, it'll hopefully fill out quite a bit.

The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Baughn/Dwarf-Fortress--libgraphics-/tree/master). I didn't fork it because it's been a while and I figured a "fresh start" might make it easier for me to track.
